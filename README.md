UCLA CS32 Winter 2023 Course Projects



## Project 1

This project aims to enhance understanding of C++ object-oriented programming, which includes the use of header files, .cpp files, classes, etc. Through this initiative, we implemented a simple blackjack result calculation program.

## Project 2

This project is designed to demonstrate the application of recursive algorithms across a variety of problem-solving scenarios. It includes several distinct recursive functions: Modulo, Occurrence Counter, String Transformation, and Subset Sum. Each function is designed to address a specific type of computational task.

## Project 3

This C++ project features the ListNode class, designed to manage elements in a linked list structure. The class supports basic linked list operations such as setting and retrieving node values, and navigating to the next node.

## Project 4

This C++ project features managing and analyzing passenger data. It loads and processes data from CSV files into a well-organized database. The project makes good use of class constructors and destructors for effective memory management, and pointers to handle data efficiently.

## Project 5

This C++ project showcases a custom deque system that efficiently manages data. It includes comprehensive tests that ensure you can add, remove, and find items reliably. The project uses a special node structure that connects elements smoothly, proving its effectiveness through various scenarios.
