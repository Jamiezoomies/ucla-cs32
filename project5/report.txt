Description:
I thought the overall coding concept for a deque was similar to doubly linked list features, plus the queue feature. 
Project 5 improved my understanding of linked lists and queues. I encountered some errors while coding, as I needed to manage proper references precisely based on cases where the deque has nothing, single node, more than one node, etc.
Initially, I didn't use the to_string function, but I noticed that it is required to parse a printItems string when the deque has a non-string type. 
All the code was successfully completed, and all my custom test cases passed.
